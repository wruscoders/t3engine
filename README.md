# TicTacToe Gaming Platform
The t3engine is a basic implementation of the game of TicTacToe. It's structures so that player implementations can be written independently and then added to a game so they can play against each other. The engine implements the Observer pattern so that additional features, like showing the progress of a game, can be implemented and integrated into the game.

Basic documentation for the engine can be found in [here](https://wruscoders.github.io/t3engine/build/html/index.html).
